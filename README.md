# SecHub Reporter Action

![test workflow][test-badge]

## Overview

This action aims to provide support for generating reports for [SecHub][sechub], a central API to test software with
different security tools.

Several output modes are supported depending on the user input and if the action is run on a pull request:
- `pr-comment` - report will be added as a comment on PR.
- `check` - report will be added in a GitHub check.
- `summary` - report will be added as a summary.

### Examples

Below we illustrate examples of expected outputs depending on the report mode.

#### Mode `pr-comment`

> ℹ️ By default when the action runs with `pr-comment` mode in a non pull-request context this mode will be ignored and
> if no additional mode was provided we will produce a report using `check` mode .

When running in `pr-comment` mode in case of no errors found you will get a comment in you pull request that should look
as follows

![pr-comment-ok](docs/images/pr_comment_ok_example.png)

If errors are found then a nice table will appear in a form of pull request comment highlighting all the important
details for the report as in the example below

![pr-comment-error](docs/images/pr_comment_error_example.png)

#### Mode `check`

When running in `check` mode a GitHub check will be created to add the report. In case of no errors found your check
will succeed, and you will get something as follows

![check-ok](docs/images/check_ok_example.png)

If errors are found, the GitHub check will fail, and you will obtain the following

![check-error](docs/images/check_error_example.png)

#### Mode `summary`

When running in `summary` mode a summary will be created with the following if no errors are found

![summary-ok](docs/images/summary_ok_example.png)

And in case of errors with the following 

![summary-error](docs/images/summary_error_example.png)
